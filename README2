My program needs to control a mouse. The first step is to change the mouse device number.

cat /proc/bus/input/devices | grep Handlers="mouse0"
% H: Handlers=mouse0 event4 
And then change the mouse event number in src/run_tld.cpp line 323
% fd_mouse = open("/dev/input/event4", O_RDWR);

cd OpenTLD
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src/
make
cd ../bin/
%To run from camera, because mouse control is part of system call, it needs to run as administrator.
sudo ./run_tld -p ../parameters.yml -tl
%Use mouse to select the region you want to check, has fun.
